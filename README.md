# hello-world
Basic repository with some ideas for things I want to code.

Hello I'm Pedro. I'm a civil engineer which is learning how to code in python. I've got a bit of experience coding Visual Basic applied to EXCEL.

In my voyage to discover python I've got a few objectives:
  -learning the language;
  -learning how to use graphics;
  -better understand file control;
  -others.
  
Along the way there will be some projects that I'm interested in trying. I'll include them in future files.
